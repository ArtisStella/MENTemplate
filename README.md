# MEN Stack Template
A very basic template to get started with MongoDB, Express and Node (MEN).

## Getting Started
Following is a detailed guide on how to get started with this stack.
You can also download the repository and use it if you are already familiar.

### Before We Begin
You need to have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime installed on your machine. For Database, MongoDB should be installed, however [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) can be used as an easier alternative.<br /> 
*It goes without saying, basic knowledge of JavaScript is to be expected.*
