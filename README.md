# MEN Stack Template
A very basic template to get started with MongoDB, Express and Node (MEN).

## Getting Started
Following is a detailed guide on how to get started with this stack.
You can also download the repository and use it if you are already familiar.

### Before We Begin
You need to have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime installed on your machine. For Database, MongoDB should be installed, however [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) can be used as an easier alternative.<br />
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for development but you can use any IDE you prefer.<br />
*Recommended Extensions: Prettier*<br />
It goes without saying, **basic knowledge of JavaScript is to be expected**.

### Setting Up The Project
Create and open a new folder for your project in VSCode.
Open the integrated terminal and initialize your project using
```
npm init -y
```
This command initializes a node.js project, -y is used to use the default settings.
If succesful, you should see `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in your folder.
